# OZ Impact
Readme edits change to show the differences between branches. 

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created incentives for investments in Opportunity Zones: 8,700 disadvantaged communities. Our project will track the social impact these publicly funded tax incentives have. The project will enable policy makers and citizens to know the actual and projected impact of Opportunity Zone projects, where the credits are going, who is receiving them, and who they serve. We will know if the tax benefits are given to high-end projects that don’t require a federal tax subsidy to be successful, or if they benefit low income Opportunity Zone residents. We use RedHat’s BlockApps STRATO Blockchain Platform.
